# Redeployment Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive redeployment feature that allows users to create new deployments based on existing deployments with optional overrides.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. New DTO (`dto/redeploy-deployment.dto.ts`)

- `RedeployDeploymentDto` with optional fields for environment, branch, and environmentVariables
- Proper validation decorators and API documentation

### 2. Service Method (`deployment.service.ts`)

- `redeployDeployment()` method that:
  - Validates ownership and permissions
  - Checks license limits and status
  - Decrypts original environment variables
  - Creates new deployment with optional overrides
  - Reuses existing `createDeployment()` method

### 3. Controller Endpoint (`deployment.controller.ts`)

- `POST /deployments/:deploymentId/redeploy` endpoint
- Proper API documentation with Swagger decorators
- Error handling for various scenarios

### 4. Documentation Updates

- Updated `README.md` with redeployment examples
- Enhanced UserLicense API docs with redeployment use cases
- Created comprehensive `redeployment-guide.md` for frontend developers

## Key Features

### Flexibility

- **Environment Override**: Deploy to different environment (preview/production)
- **Branch Override**: Deploy from different branch
- **Environment Variables Override**: Update configuration variables
- **No Override**: Quick redeploy with exact same configuration

### Security & Validation

- **Ownership Check**: Users can only redeploy their own deployments
- **License Validation**: Ensures active license with available deployment slots
- **Environment Variable Encryption**: Properly handles sensitive data
- **Authentication**: Requires valid Firebase token

### Integration with Existing System

- **UserLicense Integration**: Respects deployment limits and increments counts
- **GitHub Workflow**: Uses existing deployment pipeline
- **Round-Robin Accounts**: Leverages account rotation for reliability
- **Webhook Support**: Creates webhooks for real-time status updates

## API Usage Examples

### Basic Redeployment

```bash
POST /api/v1/deployments/deployment-uuid/redeploy
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <firebase-token>

{}  # Empty body uses original configuration
```

### Redeployment with Overrides

```bash
POST /api/v1/deployments/deployment-uuid/redeploy
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <firebase-token>

{
  "environment": "production",
  "branch": "release-v2.0",
  "environmentVariables": [
    {
      "key": "API_VERSION",
      "defaultValue": "v2",
      "description": "API version",
      "isRequired": true,
      "isSecret": false,
      "type": "text"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Response Format

Returns a new `Deployment` object with:

- New unique deployment ID
- Status: `PENDING` (initially)
- Original project and configuration references
- Updated environment/branch/variables if overridden
- New creation timestamp

## Error Handling

- `400 Bad Request`: License limits exceeded, inactive license, invalid input
- `403 Forbidden`: Not authorized to redeploy (ownership validation)
- `404 Not Found`: Original deployment not found

## Frontend Integration

The implementation includes comprehensive frontend examples for:

- React hooks and components
- Vue.js composables and components
- Error handling strategies
- UI/UX best practices

## Testing

- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Service and controller properly typed
- No test failures in existing test suite
- Ready for integration testing

## Benefits for Users

1. **Quick Rollbacks**: Easily redeploy previous configurations
2. **Environment Promotion**: Move deployments between preview and production
3. **Configuration Updates**: Update environment variables without full reconfiguration
4. **Branch Switching**: Deploy different code versions quickly
5. **Reduced Setup Time**: No need to reconfigure entire deployment from scratch

## Next Steps for Frontend Team

1. Integrate the redeployment API calls
2. Add redeployment buttons to deployment UI
3. Implement override forms for advanced options
4. Add proper error handling and user feedback
5. Test with various deployment scenarios
6. Update analytics to track redeployment usage

The feature is production-ready and maintains full compatibility with the existing UserLicense system and deployment pipeline.
